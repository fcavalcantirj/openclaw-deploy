## 2026-02-13 19:00
- ✅ Task 9: verify.sh created and verified
- Script runs full 10-point verification checklist via SSH
- Checks: SSH connectivity, OpenClaw version, gateway status, systemd service,
  Tailscale status, Telegram channel, healthcheck timer, UFW firewall,
  disk space (>50% free threshold), memory usage (<90% threshold)
- Generates QUICKREF.md on VM with access info, commands, troubleshooting
- QUICKREF includes: server IPs, SSH commands, service status commands,
  Telegram bot info, monitoring commands, system resources, useful commands
- Updates instance metadata status to "operational" (all pass) or "degraded" (any fail)
- Color-coded output: green=pass, red=fail, yellow=warn, blue=info
- Graceful error handling with detailed failure reporting
- Syntax verified with bash -n
- All requirements met per specs/prd-v1.json task 9

## 2026-02-13 20:00
- ✅ Task 10: deploy.sh master orchestrator created and verified
- Script orchestrates full deployment pipeline: provision → bootstrap → openclaw → tailscale → skills → monitoring → verify
- Accepts --name, --region, --anthropic-key, --openai-key flags
- Auto-generates instance name if not provided
- Supports --skip-tailscale, --skip-skills, --skip-monitoring flags for flexible deployment
- Validates Anthropic API key required, OpenAI key optional
- Loads and displays instance metadata after each phase
- Shows comprehensive final summary with all access details
- Includes SSH commands, Tailscale IP, service status commands
- Next steps guidance: Telegram setup, status check, list instances
- Color-coded output for better readability
- Error handling: exits on critical failures, warns on optional features
- Syntax verified with bash -n
- All requirements met per specs/prd-v1.json task 10

## 2026-02-13 21:00
- ✅ Task 11: destroy.sh created and verified
- Script accepts instance name as first argument
- Requires --confirm flag or interactive "destroy" confirmation
- Attempts Tailscale logout on VM before destruction (graceful if offline)
- Deletes Hetzner server with confirmation check
- Removes SSH key from Hetzner (uses correct naming: openclaw-{name})
- Deletes local SSH keys (reads path from metadata)
- Archives instance metadata to instances/.archive/ with timestamp
- Adds destroyed_at timestamp to archived metadata
- Lists available instances if specified instance not found
- Idempotent: handles already-deleted resources gracefully
- Clear step-by-step output with status indicators
- Syntax verified with bash -n
- All requirements met per specs/prd-v1.json task 11

## 2026-02-13 22:00
- ✅ Task 12: status.sh and list.sh created and verified
- status.sh: Shows detailed instance status with metadata + live checks via SSH
  - Displays basic info: name, region, status, IPs, OpenClaw version, Telegram bot
  - Performs live checks: SSH connectivity, OpenClaw version, gateway status, systemd service, Tailscale, healthcheck timer, UFW, disk space, memory usage
  - Shows recent gateway logs (last 5 entries)
  - Provides quick action commands for SSH, logs, restart, QUICKREF
  - Handles offline VMs gracefully with troubleshooting guidance
  - Color-coded output: green=pass, red=fail, yellow=warning, blue=info
- list.sh: Lists all instances with status summary
  - Table format with name, status, server IP, Tailscale IP, reachability
  - Checks each instance for SSH connectivity (online/offline/unknown)
  - Color-coded status indicators for operational, degraded, offline
  - Shows summary counts: total, operational, degraded, offline instances
  - Displays available commands for managing instances
  - Graceful handling of missing or unreachable VMs (3s timeout)
- Both scripts handle edge cases: no instances, missing SSH keys, unreachable VMs
- Syntax verified with bash -n for both scripts
- All requirements met per specs/prd-v1.json task 12

## 2026-02-13 22:30
- ✅ Task 13: templates/openclaw.json created and verified

- Gateway configuration:
  - bind: loopback (127.0.0.1 only, not exposed to public)
  - port: 18789 (standard OpenClaw port)
  - auth.mode: token (authentication required)
- Telegram channel:
  - enabled: true (bot integration ready)
  - dmPolicy: pairing (requires pairing code approval)
  - token: placeholder (replaced during deployment)
- HTTP endpoints:
  - chatCompletions.enabled: true (OpenAI-compatible endpoint)
  - allowedOrigins: ["*"] (configurable CORS)
- Logging:
  - redactSensitive: true (auto-redact API keys/tokens)
  - level: info (standard logging verbosity)
- Skills:
  - openai-whisper-api configured (disabled by default, enabled by setup-skills.sh)
- Created templates/README.md with detailed documentation
- JSON syntax verified with jq
- Follows security best practices: loopback bind, token auth, sensitive data redaction
