# openclaw-deploy Progress

## 2026-02-14: Install amcp-protocol CLI on VM during master-setup.sh
- Added Step 2b to scripts/master-setup.sh: idempotent `npm install -g @amcp/cli`
- Placed after Node 22 install (Step 2) and before user creation (Step 3)
- Idempotent: checks `command -v amcp` before installing
- Logs version after install
- bash -n syntax check passes
